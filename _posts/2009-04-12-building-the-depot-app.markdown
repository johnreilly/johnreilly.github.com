I got my copy of [AWDwR (v3)](http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails) a couple weeks ago, and thought it might be fun to run through building their sample "Depot" application. Gotta keep your chops up somehow, right?

It's actually been pretty useful so far... For example, I had forgotten there was a nifty <code>cycle()</code> helper available for doing zebra-striped rows in your views. 

I usually get a queasy feeling any time I'm working on something that isn't under version control, plus I figured that someone might get some use out of a nicely tagged/branched Depot repo. So, as I'm working my way through it, I've been using [git](http://git-scm.org) to tag each task and its related iterations, and creating branches for each of the "suggested exercises" (aka "playtime") at the end of each task.  

Of course, I've been pushing the repo to GitHub all the while.  You can find it here: [http://github.com/johnreilly/depot](http://github.com/johnreilly/depot).

I'm sure a million identical Depot projects exist here on GitHub (I didn't even bother searching), but that's not the point.  It's just a fun little instructive project for myself. 
 
Hopefully, the act of posting about it will be incentive enough to finish it. :)
